## Methodology for E-commerce Sales Analysis (Excel Project)
1. Data Collection
- Gather data from e-commerce platforms, transaction records, or online sales reports.
- Ensure the dataset includes key fields such as:
- Order Date: For time-based analysis.
- Product Name/Category: To identify top-selling items.
- Quantity Sold: To measure sales volume.
- Revenue: To calculate profit contributions.
- Region/Location: To analyze geographical performance.
- Customer Demographics (if available): To segment buyers.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Import the raw dataset into Excel and prepare it for analysis by performing the following steps:
- Remove Duplicates: Ensure unique transaction records.
- Handle Missing Values: Replace missing fields with averages or placeholders like "N/A".
- Format Columns: Convert dates to "Date" format, sales to "Currency", etc.
- Standardize Data: Unify product or category names to avoid inconsistencies (e.g., "T-Shirts" vs. "tshirts").
3. Data Analysis
Use Excel formulas and tools for insights:

Use PivotTables to summarize daily, weekly, or monthly revenue.
Analyze growth patterns over time.

Create charts and dashboards in Excel to present insights:

- Bar Charts: Compare product or category performance.
- Line Charts: Show trends in revenue over time (e.g., monthly growth).
- Pie Charts: Highlight category contributions to total sales.
- Heatmaps: Use conditional formatting to visualize regions with the highest sales.
